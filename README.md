  In this project we intended to maintain the vehicles inside the campus and provide the security.
  
## Vehicle number plate detection and recognition using YOLO and EasyOCR

- In this we used Yolov8 model for the detection of the number plate.
- And for the recognition of characters in the number plate we have used EasyOCR module.


## Vehicle tracking and counting using YOLO and DeepSort

- In this we have used yolov8 for vehicle detection.
- And also we used DeepSort to detect the vehicles in the motion.
